									<h2>Hello, I'm Kevin Kaiser.</h2>
									<p>I graduated from Rowan University in December 2019. 
										Designing websites is my passion that I am looking to pursue as a full time career. 
										I have skills and projects that showcase both Front End and Back End Web Development capabilities.
										Featured below are examples of my work developing websites using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap, jQuery, REST APIs, SQL, Unix, and cURL. 
									</p>

								<h2>Sushi Monster</h2>
								<p> Sushi Monster is a restaurant website designed by myself. The goal of this website is to showcase a modern restaurant website. HTML, CSS, and Boostrap are used to design the website's layout and style. 
									Javascript and jQuery are used to create functionality for features such as the navbar, smooth scroll, ripple effects, and image gallery pop-up.

									<p>Local Movies is a Senior Project for Rowan University. The team members are Kevin Kaiser, Carl Koenig, Robert Leslie, and Smitkumar Patel.
										The goals of the website are to allow users to look up basic information about movies, see what current movies are playing in their area, and receive a text message with information
										about the showtime such as the movie name, theater location, and the time the movie was playing.
										Our team used multiple APIs including International Showtimes, The Movie Database, Geoplugin, Google Places, and Twilio in order to create our website. 
										My responsibility for the website was to format the HTML and CSS for all pages as well as work with The Movie Database API to create a search function using PHP and cURL 
										for users to look up basic information about any movie in the database. We also used SQL and PHP to store information from the databases from The Movie Database 
										and International Showtimes into our school's database and used Unix to navigate through our school's server to host our website. 
										A live demo is not available due to free API trials being expired for multiple APIs.

									<h2>Built With: HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Unix</h2>
									<p>Eat'Em is a final project for the Web Development class at Rowan University. The team members are Kevin Kaiser, Connor Keenan, Joseph Gaudio, and Issouf Kindou. 
										The goals of the website are to allow users to create an account, order from a restaurant, and allow restaurants to list their menus on the website.
										Our team used PHP and SQL to store the users' encrypted information and restaurants' menus on the school's database and used Unix to navigate through the school's server to host our website. 
										My responsibility for the website was to format the HTML and CSS for all pages as well as create the functionality of the Homepage, Sign In, Sign Up, and Order Confirmation pages using PHP
										and store data for the appropriate pages using SQL. </p>
